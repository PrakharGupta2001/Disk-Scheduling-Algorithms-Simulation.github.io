# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms-Simulation.github.io
This project aims to simulate various disk scheduling algorithms, which are essential components of operating systems. These algorithms determine the order in which requests for disk input/output (I/O) operations are processed. In other words, they decide which process gets access to the disk first and how the disk head should move to access the data requested by the processes.

## The following disk scheduling algorithms are implemented in this project:

FCFS (First-Come-First-Served)
SCAN (Elevator algorithm)
C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
LOOK

## Installation
To run this simulation, you need a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simply download or clone this repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Usage
To run the simulation, open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be prompted to enter the number of requests to simulate and the range of track numbers. After that, you can choose which disk scheduling algorithm to use. The simulation will generate a graph that shows the movement of the disk head and the order in which the requests are processed.

## Contributing
This project is open for contributions. If you want to add a new disk scheduling algorithm or improve the existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request.
